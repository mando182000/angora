 <h2>The dynasty</h2>
 <p>
    information about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names,the most important being the narmer paletta and narmer macehead ,as well as den and Qa’a kings lists .No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived,except for the terse lists on the palermo stone.The account in manetho’s aegyptiaca contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records:manetho names nine rulers of the first dynasty,only one of whose names matches the other sources,and offers informationfor only four of them .egyption hieroglyphs were fully developed by then,and their shapes would be used with little changes for morethen three thousand years .<sup> [citation neaded]</sup>
